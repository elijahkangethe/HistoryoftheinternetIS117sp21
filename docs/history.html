            <h5>History of the internet The invention of the internet</h5>
            <p>

                The internet is a critical aspect of modern society because it has increased global economic opportunities and has made remote communication more convenient. Likewise, the conceptualization of the internet was started by J.C.R. Licklider an MIT psychology professor. Moreover, early computer technology contributed to creating the internet because early computers were eventually used to create internet based communication.
                Query theory was conceptualized at MIT to begin early computer communication. Likewise, the Internet’s creation was instigated by the United States military to create a robust communication system in order to defend national security. Moreover, Dr. Paul Baran was  leading a project to create hot potato routing to highlight how the internet can still be accessed if one route is disconnected the signal can still be transmitted through a different route connected in the network. Likewise, hot potato routing also led to creating internet packets which is when data is split into smaller pieces to make it easier to transmit. Moreover, in the year 1969 Project Manager Frank Heart was working with the company BBN to create a packet switching system called the ARPA net and was tasked to create a communication line at UCLA. On “September 1st 1969”(23:43) the first piece of internet communication hardware arrived at UCLA (23:53). In April 1971 the “ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers”(24:30) The ARPANET was primarily installed at government facilities. However, private networks for business use was developed during the 1980s and then Consumer websites became available soon after. Moreover, the most popular consumer internet service was AOL. Likewise, what popularized the internet for common people was when the US government opened the internet for public use on “1992”(36:53) Therefore, the internet became widely available and has made global communication more convenient. Moreover, the internet opened numerous economic opportunities as well because numerous early e-commerce websites opened and became available to the general public
