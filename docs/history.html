            <h5>History of the Internet the Invention of the Internet</h5>
            <p>

                The internet is a critical aspect of modern society because it has increased global economic opportunities and has made remote communication more convenient. Likewise, the conceptualization of the internet was started by J.C.R. Licklider an MIT psychology professor. Moreover, early computer technology contributed to creating the internet because early computers were eventually used to create internet based communication.
                Query theory was conceptualized at MIT to begin early computer communication. Likewise, the Internet’s creation was instigated by the United States military to create a robust communication system in order to defend national security. Moreover, Dr. Paul Baran was  leading a project to create hot potato routing to highlight how the internet can still be accessed if one route is disconnected the signal can still be transmitted through a different route connected in the network. Likewise, hot potato routing also led to creating internet packets which is when data is split into smaller pieces to make it easier to transmit. Moreover, in the year 1969 Project Manager Frank Heart was working with the company BBN to create a packet switching system called the ARPA net and was tasked to create a communication line at UCLA. On “September 1st 1969”(23:43 Narrator) the first piece of internet communication hardware arrived at UCLA (23:53). In April 1971 the “ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers”(24:30 Narrator) The ARPANET was primarily installed at government facilities. However, private networks for business use was developed during the 1980s and then Consumer websites became available soon after. Moreover, the most popular consumer internet service was AOL. Likewise, what popularized the internet for common people was when the US government opened the internet for public use on “1992”(36:53 Narrator) Therefore, the internet became widely available and has made global communication more convenient. Moreover, the internet opened numerous economic opportunities as well because numerous early e-commerce websites opened and became available to the general public

            <h5>History of the Internet Web Browsers </h5>
            <p>

                The internet is a critical aspect of modern communications in the early internet there were numerous web browser services that struggled to compete for market dominance. Moreover, early web browser creator Marc Andreessen was a Netscape co-founder which was responsible for enhancing an average person’s web browsing experience. Likewise, Andreessen and his web development team created Mosaic the earliest web browser with a user friendly graphical user interface.
                Likewise, Jim Clark heavily invested in expanding Mosaic and making it widely available. However, Mosaic was extremely difficult to market because Jim Clark was the only investor the Mosaic development team had at the time. Meanwhile, other leaders in the technology industry such as Bill Gates Microsoft's co-founder wanted to create a web browsing experience wholly dominated by Microsoft. Therefore, Bill Gates actively competed against Netscape by introducing its own MSN service for computers. Moreover, Microsoft tried to intimidate Netscape by holding a meeting with it’s employees and made an aggressive offer to buy Netscape’s resources so Microsoft would no longer have competition against them. “In August 1995”(26:20 John Heilemann) Netscape chose to be publicly listed on stock exchange platforms, to collect funding to enhance it’s products. Netscape’s initial public offering made Netscape extremely wealthy which instigated Microsoft to create and release the internet explorer browser. Moreover, Microsoft created aggressive competition when they made internet explorer available for free, which caused Netscape to be used less often because people had to buy Netscape to use it. However, Microsoft’s aggressive business strategies were effective and usage of the Netscape browser had fallen drastically and they were acquired by AOL. Furthermore, “its 1998 and the United States Department of Justice...has launched a historic antitrust lawsuit.”(38:24 John Heilemann) Microsoft was being scrutinized by legal experts and the department of Justice for using unlawful business strategies to unfairly gain market dominance and cause companies like Netscape to be absorbed into other companies or possibly face closure because they could no longer freely compete in the internet browser industry. The Judge found Bill Gates guilty in the trial and caused Microsoft’s stock market value to plummet.
                It is critical for software companies like Netscape to be able to compete freely to create an even competitive market. Likewise, it is important to prevent immense companies like Microsoft from using their financial resources to create campaigns to remove smaller competitors like Netscape from being able to compete and sell their products to the general public.

            <h5>History of the Internet Search Engines</h5>
            <p>

                Prior to modern search engines organizing billions of web pages into a convenient easy to read format people using the early internet in the mid 1990s had to manually search for web pages which made browsing the internet strenuous until the founders of Yahoo Jerry Yang and David Filo created the first easy to use search engine. Moreover, Yahoo’s largest competitor was excite founded by Joe Kraus it was technologically superior than Yahoo because the websites Yahoo has listed on their platform were manually indexed. However, the websites Excite displayed were automatically indexed by a program. Moreover, after Yahoo and Excite have solidified dominance in the search engine industry Google started at Stanford university and expanded quickly. Moreover, Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were approached by Vinod Khosla who wanted Excite to borrow Google’s indexing program to improve on Excite’s web page indexing. However, Excite declined to work with Google which was a missed financial opportunity because Google is more commonly used than Excite and has a larger market value. Google was able to rapidly expand it’s operations because wealthy investors like Andy Bechtolsheim invested large sums of money into Google. “So I rushed out to my car and pull out my checkbook and wrote them a check on the spot.”(Andy Bechtolsheim 22:53-22:57 ) “He came back with a checkbook and wrote us a check for 100,000 dollars.”(Sergey Brin 22:54-22:59) However, Google struggled to make revenue, but Bill Gross figured out how to make ad revenue without cluttering a search engine menu with banner ads that could annoy internet users. Gross’ technique was to gather the internet searches of the people using the internet, store that data, and would use keywords purchased by companies that would like to advertise using Gross’ system to sway internet users to buy their product. Despite the skepticism from Gross’ staff members at a meeting. Gross states. “Come its just like the yellow pages...Think how useful the yellow pages are...Look how useful this is. Why wouldn't that be helpful?” (Gross31:30-31:52) Google studied Gross’ keyword advertising and adapted into the Google search engine and became massively successful and wealthy. Moreover, Google in the long term has outgrown Yahoo, Excite, and Bill Gross’ company IdeaSpace, because of wealthy venture capitalists investing money into Google. Likewise, Google has made browsing the internet easier and more convenient than search engines like Excite and Yahoo because their advertising is not interrupting a user’s web browsing experience.

            <h5>History of the Internet Dot Com Bubble</h5>
            <p>
                During the Internet's development to monetize it numerous companies began figuring out how to monetize internet content besides advertising. The earliest major e-commerce websites Amazon and eBay found out how to effectively sell products online and began popularizing online shopping. “Bezos launched amazon in the summer of 1995”(John Heilemann 3:18-3:21) Likewise, Pierre Omidyar launched eBay on a similar time and became Bezos’ first competitor in e-commerce. Moreover, Amazon and eBay were tremendously successful in their early stages similar to the success stories of Google and Yahoo the details of their success were covered in the previous historical summary. During the increase of e-commerce transactions in the 1990s and 2000s it created the need for better cybersecurity innovations to protect e-commerce customer’s data during online transactions. Encrypting user data when a transaction is submitted creates secure payments for e-commerce users and sellers. Likewise, what contributed to the dot com bubble was when newly founded companies like eBay went public and many people began investing in their shares. Likewise, other newly created companies struggled to remain profitable because they spent excessive sums of money on unnecessary events. Philip Kaplan States. “People were just spending crazy amounts of money... they spent 10 million dollars on their launch party. they raised 12 million and spent 10 million on the party.”(Kaplan 24:18)  John Doerr also makes an insightful statement about how many new e-commerce companies made terrible business decisions. “Very energetic nearly frantic time when it was easy to lose your bearings and some of your judgment.”(Doerr 25:43-25:53) Likewise, after the dot com bubble burst many e-commerce companies went bankrupt because they had spent their investors money and were not profitable enough to repay their expenses. Likewise, when the dot com bubble burst it redefined e-commerce and now modern tech companies are more cautious to they do not risk going bankrupt over bad business decisions.

            <h5>History of the Internet People</h5>
            <p>
                The internet has changed how people can communicate with other groups of people. Likewise, the internet has expanded immensely due to the extremely high demand for accessing and using the internet. Likewise, major companies like Yahoo, Google, Amazon, eBay, Digg, and Facebook, have made the internet more accessible to the general public. For example, Google and Yahoo indexed internet web pages so users could find what they would like to see online quickly. Moreover, companies like Facebook have made the internet even more popular than it already was by creating a successful social media website. Moreover, websites like Youtube have also redefined entertainment because the general public has the option to watch entertaining content on the internet. Moreover, Digg popularized the concept of users deciding what articles gets featured on their social media news article hybrid website. Likewise, Digg’s casual atmosphere is what made it popular among people on the internet because the user has voting power to what gets featured. However, what also popularized the internet was when Apple opened Itunes to the internet so users can purchase music. Purchasing music digitally through Itunes was extremely effective for Apple because Itunes had support from many music producers. Therefore, Apple was able to generate revenue from music sales which was shared between Apple and the music producers. Moreover, other services on the internet such as Craigslist have also changed the internet because Craigslist is not immensely profitable like google or Facebook, but also provides services similar to eBay where users can buy and sell products online.
                The Internet through it’s early development in the 1960s has changed drastically since it was made available to general public in the early 1990s. Moreover, the internet has brought numerous positive social changes because the general public can search for online products, communicate with other people, and browse the internet through organized web search engines like google using a computer or other internet connected devices.
